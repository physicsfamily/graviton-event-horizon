# Welcome to Entropy Zero

We are thrilled to announce the launch of **Entropy Zero**, a next-generation simulation engine built from the ground up in Rust.

## Why Rust?

Performance matters. When simulating complex physical systems, every microsecond counts. Rust gives us:

- **Zero-cost abstractions** — High-level code that compiles to optimal machine instructions
- **Memory safety** — No garbage collection pauses, no null pointer exceptions
- **Fearless concurrency** — Parallel simulations without data races

## What Can You Simulate?

Entropy Zero is designed for scientific and engineering applications:

- Particle physics simulations
- Fluid dynamics modeling
- Thermodynamic systems
- Custom constraint-based physics

## Getting Started

Head over to our [documentation](/docs) to learn how to integrate Entropy Zero into your projects.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in simulation technology.
